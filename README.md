# The-100-Prisoners-Problem-in-rust
## program to demostrate the 100 prisiones problem written in rust.


### *The director of a prison offers 100 death row prisoners, who are numbered from 1 to 100, a last chance.* <br/>
*A room contains a cupboard with 100 drawers. The director randomly puts one prisoner's number in each closed drawer*.<br/>
*The prisoners enter the room, one after another. Each prisoner may open and look into 50 drawers in any order.* <br/>
*The drawers are closed again afterwards. If, during this search, every prisoner finds their number in one of the drawers,*<br/>
*all prisoners are pardoned. If just one prisoner does not find their number, all prisoners die.*<br/>
*Before the first prisoner enters the room, the prisoners may discuss strategy â€” but may not communicate once the first prisoner enters to look in the drawers.*<br/>
*What is the prisoners' best strategy?*<br/>

## Strategy to have 30% of success posibility
